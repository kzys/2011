<p>
  Last year, I sent some patches to Scaladoc.
  And last month, I got a commit bit for Scaladoc
  (a part of the Scala repository).
  Thank you Gilles Dubochet and Martin Odersky for the offer.
</p>
<p>
  Current Scaladoc is not &quot;perfect&quot;.
  This is why
  <a href="http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/liftweb-2.2/framework/scaladocs/index.html">Lift's API documents</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html">Scala's documents</a>
  are very different from each other.
  Lift uses
  <a href="https://github.com/davidB/vscaladoc">VScaladoc</a>
  instead of Scaladoc.
  And another notable alternative is
  <a href="http://novocode.com/tmp/extradoc/">Extradoc</a>.
  Both are great and competition is good thing for the Scala community.
</p>
<p>
  My full time job is a web enginner.
  Scaladoc needs improvement at HTML/CSS/JavaScript layer
  and I think I can help improve it.
