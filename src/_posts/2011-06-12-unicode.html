  &quot;Unicode <em>Senki</em>&quot;
  (<em>Senki</em> is &quot;war chronicle&quot; in Japanese)
  is an interesting documentary about Unicode and standarization.
  This book was written by Kobayashi Tatsuo,
  ex-JustSytems and the co-director of the Unicode Consortium.

  &quot;Defined by the specification&quot; is acutually
  &quot;Defined by someone wrote the specification&quot;.
  This book shows how standarization folks struggle the difficulity
  and how Japanese tackle an international project.
  Really impressed.

  Last year I watched
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/maillist.html">the mailing list of OAuth</a>
  carefully because we need to release new product with
  OAuth 2.0 based authorization.
  But I didn't join the discussion. My ex-boss did it on OpenSocial.

  Sometimes my coworker said
  &quot;it's a WebKit/Fx's bug. I can't fix it.&quot;.
  It's little frustrated for me because they divide the world very easily.
  Divide and conquer? Well, but if you find a bug,
  you get a chance to contribute the community.
  It's really interesting experience.

<p>
  However I should see that
  I did't tackle the specification (or the standarization) yet.
  Some of caused by my English skill, but some is not.
