  On Friday, I talked about Scaladoc at
  <a href="http://partake.in/events/d625cbd2-d26c-4b4d-bd78-5c937232c848">Ariel Area Benkyou-kai</a>
  (in English, study meet up?).
  These are <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/scala-ariel.pdf">my slides</a>.
  I had five minutes on stage. But I could't give a talk in five minutes.
  So I was in a hurry to talk and extended my session a little.
</p>
<p>
  I should practice more,
  or I'll make an automatic slide show software
  (like <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">Pecha Kucha</a>)
  to keep my speed.
  So sorry.
