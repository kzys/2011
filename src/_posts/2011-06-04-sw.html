<p>
  Have you ever read Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000020.html">Strategy Letter IV: Bloatware and the 80/20 Myth</a>?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A lot of software developers are seduced by the old &quot;80/20&quot; rule. It seems to make a lot of sense: 80% of the people use 20% of the features. So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20% of the features, and you can still sell 80% as many copies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, it's never the same 20%. Everybody uses a different set of features. In the last 10 years I have probably heard of dozens of companies who, determined not to learn from each other, tried to release &quot;lite&quot; word processors that only implement 20% of the features.

  I think
  <a href="http://ogp.me/">The Open Graph Protocol</a>
  is the lite edition of
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">the Semantic Web</a>.
  And Google, Microsoft and Yahoo announced
  <a href="http://www.schema.org/">schema.org</a>,
  an another 20% of the Semantic Web.
