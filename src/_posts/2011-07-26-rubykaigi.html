<h3>Aaron Peterson - Ruby Ruined My Life</h3>
<p>
  Before his talk, Kakutani said on a dais:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Please sit more closely together!
    Aaron will feel alone if you sit separetly.
    Hey! don't sit here. Please come on.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  People won't do this on any other tech conference.
  But here is RubyKaigi. People (especially staffs) are so kind
  even if you don't think it's hacker-esque.
</p>
<p>
  Aaron talked about various topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_opstRvpM">His Movie</a></li>
  <li>Boundaries</li>
  <li>Gems
    - @miyagawa watched the keynote (on Ustream)
    and tweeted about Perl and CPAN</li>
  <li>DTrace</li>
</ul>
<p>
  And &quot;Ruby Ruined My Life&quot;.
  He decided to join a small startup <em>with a pay cut</em>
  because he want to use Ruby.
  I rememberd
  Jacob Kaplan-Moss's
  <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/thank-you-rails/">Thank you, Rails</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After the keynote, I went to Shinjuku to take a lesson of English.
</p>

<h3>Andy Delcambre - Toggleable Mocks and Testing Strategies in a Service Oriented Architecture</h3>
<p>
  &quot;Service Oriented Architecture&quot; sounds Enterprisey.
  But maybe it means &quot;loosely-coupled, HTTP-based system&quot;.
  So I should use these technique for testing our (my company's) system.
</p>

<h3>Matsumoto Yukihiro - Lightweight Ruby</h3>
<p>
  Matz talked about his new embeddable,
  Lua-like implementation of Ruby: Rite.
</p>
<p>
  Technically, it's interesting.
  But I hope it won't become a new boundary on Ruby world.
</p>

<h3>Nakamura Narihiro - A Parallel World of CRuby GC</h3>
<p>
  Before Nari's talk, I found Aaron Peterson on the seats.
  And
  <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/07/14/name-tag.html">my name tag</a>
  contains &quot;XML is like violence&quot; and
  &quot;What Would Freddie Mercury Do&quot;.
  I wanna show it for him!
  [<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html">Calm down, what are you a little girl?</a>]
</p>
<p>
  That's why I couldn't listen Nari's talk well...
  But I showed &quot;What Would Freddie Mercury Do&quot; to Aaron Peterson!
</p>

<h3>Sasada Koichi - Ruby Implementations on A Parallel World</h3>
<p>
  Sasada talked about his students research.
  Multiple VM + Channel seems interesting.
</p>

<h3>Dinner</h3>
<p>
  When I show my name tag to Aaron, Some people asked to me:
  &quot;Oh, what is this?&quot;. They are @masuidrive's partner and @takachin.
  And I found Toshi (my ex-coworker) and his friends.
</p>
<p>
  I had a dinner with them and some of speakers from foreign countries.
  So I couldn't see &quot;Yami RubyKaigi&quot; but the dinner is interesting.
  And it changed my mind.
</p>
<p>
  I should talk more speakers and attendees even if my English is broken.
