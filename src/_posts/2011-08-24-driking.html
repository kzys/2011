title: 30 Day Challenge - Stop Drinking
layout: post
---
<p>
  In July 24, I decided to stop driking for 30 days.
  Because my coworker who joined in the same year, decided and did it.
  And my ex-coworker began his 30 day challenge:
  <a href="http://pumpkinsugar.posterous.com/30days-1">write something
    in English, everyday</a>.
  Actually last Monday was my goal but I couldn't notice it.
</p>
<h3>Good</h3>
<p>
  During 30 days, I don't need to look at a liquor corner at
  a supermarket and a convinience store.
  And probably I can think clearly at night.
</p>
<h3>Not so good</h3>
<p>
  I canceled a party once. And I know that some foods should be
  serverd with beer, wine or sake.
</p>
<h3>Conculusion</h3>
<p>
  Normally I don't drink.
  I like drinking but I decide to change my &quot;default&quot;
  because I need time to do something...
