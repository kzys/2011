  I've got a daily prize (May 4) and a weekly prize (May 2-7)
  from <a href="http://rewardjs.com/">RewardJS</a>!

  For me, RewardJS is a good opportunity to begin contributing jQuery UI.
  Thank you for RewardJS, <a href="http://bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/203">Corey Frang</a>.
  I'm glad to contribute to such a great project.

  Of course, I'm glad to get Wii and iPad 2 too :)
