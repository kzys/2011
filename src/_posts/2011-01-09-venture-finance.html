  I read Isozaki Tetsuya's
  &quot;Venture Finance - The Essential Guide for Entreprenuers&quot;.
  The author's writing style is too casual for me.
  But the content is interesting and practical.

  Personally, I like a small &ndash;

  &ndash; startup.
  37signals's &quot;Rework&quot; has a chapter called
  &quot;Outside money is plan B&quot;.
  Today, Apple, Google and Amazon provide
  a &quot;store&quot; and a payment service for individial developers.
  Amazon also provide EC2, S3 and CloudFront.
  We don't need a large company for a software business.

  However, &quot;We are small&quot; is not a good reason to ignore finance,
  I think.
