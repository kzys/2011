  I read Isozaki Tetsuya's
  &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4534047576?ie=UTF8&tag=8pinfo-22&linkCode=as2&camp=247&creative=7399&creativeASIN=4534047576">Venture Finance - The Essential Guide for Entreprenuers</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.jp/e/ir?t=8pinfo-22&l=as2&o=9&a=4534047576" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&quot;.
  The author's writing style is too casual for me.
  But the content is interesting and practical.

  Personally, I like a small &ndash;
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sitesearch=37signals.com%2Fsvn&q=%22Bootstrapped%2C+Profitable%2C+%26+Proud%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=">Bootstrapped, Profitable, &amp; Proud</a>
  &ndash; startup.
  37signals's &quot;Rework&quot; has a chapter called
  &quot;Outside money is plan B&quot;.
  Today, Apple, Google and Amazon provide
  a &quot;store&quot; and a payment service for individial developers.
  Amazon also provide EC2, S3 and CloudFront.
  We don't need a large company for a software business.

<p>
  However, &quot;We are small&quot; is not a good reason to ignore finance,
  I think.
