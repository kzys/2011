  It's middle of the year now. So I'll review my three months.
</p>

<h3>Eikaiwa school</h3>
<p>
  I decided to go to an
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikaiwa_school">Eikaiwa school</a> to
  improve my English.
  Today there are many Skype-style Eikaiwa schools.
  But I'm too lazy to launch Skype periodically.
  That's why I go to a good old fashioned school.
  Actually, the school is just a &quot;pace maker&quot;.
  I need to study more by myself.

<h3>Scala</h3>
<p>
  Scala 2.9 released. And new Scaladoc was accepted well by the community.
  I gave a short talk about Scaladoc at Tokyo.
  On my last slide, I quoted
  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/quelgar/status/68828779929272320">the tweet of Lachlan O'Dea</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Scala 2.9 is out, sweet.
    Docs don't make headlines,
    but my favourite feature is the new Scaladoc.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad to get such positive feedbacks.</p>

<h3>RewardJS</h3>
<p>
  I fixed some bugs on jQuery UI and
  I got iPad 2, iPod touch, Nintendo Wii, &quot;Eloquent JavaScript&quot book
  and one year subscription of Grooveshark Anywhere.
  Can you beleive?
</p>

</p>
<p>
  But I ashamed a little. Because I didn't fix bug after RewardJS.

<h3>The earthquake and the nuclear power plant</h3>
<p>
  Have you ever see an angry man on a station
  when a train accident occurred?
  He shouts at the staff, &quot;I'LL LATE! MOVE THE TRAIN!&quot;.
  Does he makes things better?
</p>
<p>
  I saw the anti-nuclear demo at Shinjuku.
  It's biggest demo I've never seen.
  I'm confused and I rememberd the angry man.
