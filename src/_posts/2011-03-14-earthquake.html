  Fukushima is my birthplace. My family still living at Aizu.
  However, they are still alive! I phoned and emailed them.

  My favorite xkcd is <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">Duty Calls</a>.
  I've read more and more information on the Internet.
  Some is wrong, some is misguided and some is outdated.
  I can tweet like &quot;It's wrong! RT: ...&quot;.
  But I don't.

  I'm not familiar with a nuclear physics, an earthquake and journalism.
  I'll donate and save electricity. But other things are same as usual.
  It's my duty.
