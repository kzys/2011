<p>Better late than naver. I will write an last entry about RubyKaigi.</p>
<h3>ucnv - Visual Glitch, using Ruby</h3>
<p>
  Maybe, <em>glith</em> is fresh for Ruby programmers.
  But I think it's not so minor.
  For example, Kanye West used it on his video.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  ucnv talked about a definition, techniques and
  his libraries: AviGlitch and PhotoShop.
</p>

<h3>Andrew Grimm - Finding Black Holes in Ruby with the Small Eigen Collider</h3>
<p>
  Andrew talked about Small Eigen Collider.
  I think SEC is a kind of <em>fuzzing</em>.
  So I asked on the session: Why don't you generate whole Ruby code?
  His answer is clear: Because it's difficult and too complex.
  I got it.
  We can generate whole Ruby code, but it's not easy to report the difference
  between implementations. SEC is more pragmatic way to do it.
</p>

<h3>Inoue Makoto - The Great Eastern Japan Earthquake and what you can do as a Rubyist?</h3>
<p>
  Makoto talked about sinsai.info, Ushahidi-based site for the earthquake.
  Fukushima is my home. Maybe I shoud do something,
  but I didn't do anything yet...
</p>

<h3>Akita Fabio Makto - Personal Dilemma: How to work with Ruby in Brazil?</h3>
<p>
  Akita talked about his challenge - how to work with Ruby in Brazil.
  But his talk is not tied to Ruby. He talked &quot;how to adopt good
  technology outside the States&quot;.
  His talk and passion is really impressive.
</p>

<h3>Asari Hirotsugu - Know Ruby, will travel</h3>
<p>
  Hiro talked about &quot;how to work in foreign countries&quot;.
  His advice is not easy, but pratical.
</p>

<h3>Matsumoto Yukihiro - Pendulum, PG and the hundred year language</h3>
<p>
  And Matz! His talk was really fun.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In Japan, many programmers (even young programmers) write own language.
  </li>
  <li>It's crowded market, or <em><a href="http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=792">Kodoku</a></em>. (Note: most Japanese don't know Kodoku)</li>
  <li>And Ruby is the dominant, best player in the market. If you make new language. I will crush you!</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some programmers are great, some programmers (ex. Tatsuhiko Miyagawa) is cool, and Matz is nice. I know.
