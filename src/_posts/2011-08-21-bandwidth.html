  Motohiro (my friend) wrote about his 30 day challenge:
  <a href="http://mootoh.tumblr.com/post/9181954804/30days-1">Stop Reading Feeds</a> (in Japanese).
  After reading his post,
  I remembered &quot;Expand Your Bandwidth&quot; - a pattern from
  &quot;Apprenticeship Patterns&quot;.
  &quot;Expand Your Bandwidth&quot;
  means read blogs, join a local user group and so on.
  But it has a good additional advice.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Once you understand how to Expand Your Bandwidth, the next step
    is to understand when to Expand Your Bandwidth.

  Now I read 40 blogs. But several years ago, I read more blogs.
  Was I wrong? I don't think so.
