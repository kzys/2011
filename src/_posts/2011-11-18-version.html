title: How to versionize own fork of CPAN modules?
layout: post

<p>
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Regexp-Optimizer-0.15/">Regexp::Optimizer 0.15</a> doesn't work well with Perl 5.14.
  Yesterday I fixed and bumped up the version to 0.15_google.
  Well, &quot;google&quot; is just an example.
  I mean, I added a suffix to distinguish our version from the original.
  However I couldn't use the version on Perl.
</p>
<pre>
% perl -Mversion -e 'warn version->parse(&quot;0.15_google&quot;)'
Invalid version format (non-numeric data) at -e line 1.
%
</pre>
<p>
  I thought a little and found a <em>leet</em> solution to the problem.
</p>
<pre>
% perl -Mversion -e 'warn version->parse(&quot;0.15_900913&quot;)'
0.15_900913 at -e line 1.
%
</pre>
<p>
  How cool? but many companies can't use the trick.

<h3>We need a new version specification for Carton era</h3>
<p>
  I think <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa/carton">Carton</a>
  will give us the definitive way to manage dependencies on
  Perl applications.
  Then version.pm should provide more expressive way to
  distinguish many versions.
</p>
<p>
  rpm, dpkg and <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>
  allow to use alphabet on version numbers.
  Why don't we follow the predecessors?
