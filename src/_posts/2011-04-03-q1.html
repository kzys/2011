<p>
  April is here. Then I will look back 3 months.
</p>

<h3>Move</h3>
<p>
  I live in Nakano-ku since this January.
  Now I can see the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building from my room!

</p>

<h3>Scala</h3>
<p>
  On January, I got commit rights on
  <code>src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/</code>.
  But I also need to modify under
  <code>src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/</code> and
  <code>test/scaladoc/</code> to close some bugs.
  So I emailed and got rights on whole <code>trunk/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I rewrote a search feature, closed some bugs and added a test suite.
  Surprisedly
  <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/24662">Paul Philipps
    uses my test suite</a>.
  Gaiants standing on the shoulders of dwarfs!
</p>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
  I attended <a href="http://www.wakateit.org/">Wakate IT Benkyou-kai</a>,
  mixi Enginners' Seminar, ITEigo and
  <a href="http://shibuyajs.org/">Shibuya.js</a>.
</p>

<h3>The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake</h3>
<p>
  And last but not least, the earthquake.
  Tokyo is back to normal. But the news told about NPP everyday.
  Most of you know Fukushima as the place where there is Fukushima I NPP.
  However Fukushima is my home.
