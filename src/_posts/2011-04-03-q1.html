<p>
  April is here. Then I will look back 3 months.
</p>

<h3>Move</h3>
<p>
  I live in Nakano-ku since this January.
  Now I can see the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building from my room!

<h3>Scala</h3>
<p>
  On January, I got commit rights on
  <code>trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/</code>.
  But while improving Scaladoc,
  I need to commit <code>src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/</code>
  and <code>test/scaladoc/</code> too.
  So I emailed and got commit rights on whole <code>trunk/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I rewrote a search feature, closed some bugs and added a test suite.
  Surprisedly
  <a href="http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/24662">Paul Philipps
    uses my test suite</a>.
  Gaiants standing on the shoulders of dwarfs!

<h3>The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake</h3>
<p>
  And last but not least, the earthquake.
  You probably know Fukushima as the place where there is Fukushima I NPP.
  However Fukushima is my home.
