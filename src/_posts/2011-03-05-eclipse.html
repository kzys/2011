  What is your favorite IDE/editor for writing Scala?
  Eclipse, InteliJ IDEA, NetBeans or Emacs?

  Martin Odersky uses Eclipse.
  On Jonathan Edwards' blog,
  <a href="http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=562#comment-58901">Odersky
    commented</a>
  about the new version of the Scala plugin</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I just wanted to say that my company Scala Solutions
    has taken the over development of the Eclipse IDE for Scala.
    We should have a first beta out together with the release of Scala 2.9,
    in a couple of weeks.
    I have personally spent quite a lot of time improving
    the interface with the compiler.
    I have now switched for all of my development work
    to our as yet unreleased version of the Scala plugin for Eclipse.
    Thatâ€™s after 20 years of emacs. And I am not looking back.
