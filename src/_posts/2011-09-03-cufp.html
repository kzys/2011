<p>
  I decided to attend the 3rd day of
  <a href="http://cufp.org/">Commercial Users of Functional Programming</a>.
  In Tokyo, we hold many events and conferences.
  But most are community driven and very inexpensive.
  Then for me, CUFP seems a little expensive.
  And sadly, my English is not enough to understand talks...

  But I'll jump into the new world.
