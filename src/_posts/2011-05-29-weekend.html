  I got <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/05/10/rewardjs.html">iPad, Nintendo Wii</a> and iPod touch at Saturday morning.
  Thank you <a href="http://rewardjs.com/">RewardJS</a>

<h3>Octocat Mug</h3>
<p>
  My friend and I ordered five
  <a href="http://shop.github.com/products/octocat-mug">Octocat Mugs</a>
  at May 11.
  These mugs are arrived and I got my one on
  <a href="http://hemel.o0o0.jp/">Hemel</a> at Saturday night.
  I talked my friend and his friends (they bought a mug from him).
  We are all programmers.
  So we talked about <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/">Know Your Meme</a>,
  JavaScript,
  <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">The Pomodoro Technique</a>,
  Chrome,
  <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/">Russ Cox</a>,
  RPC,
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/">Rietveld</a>
  and a bunch of geeky stuff.

<h3>Android and Arduino</h3>
<p>
  And now, I have 3 iOS devices because I still use iPhone 3G.
  I think it's good time to buy Android instead of iPhone.
  First I've ordered <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9947">USB Host Shield</a> at <a href="http://www.switch-science.com/products/detail.php?product_id=438">Switch Science</a>.
  I want to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html">Android Open Accessory Development Kit</a>
  but &quot;Android Open Accessory compatible development boards&quot; are too expensive.
