  I gave a talk at <a href="http://atnd.org/events/13078">ITEigo</a>
  on February 25.
  ITEigo is (mostly) non-native speaker's
  &quot;try-to-use-English&quot; meetup.
  And we rent EC Navi's in-company bar, AJITO. It's a really great space!

  I talked about my experience about Scaladoc.
  <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/iteigo4.pdf">My slides</a> are here.
  So I wrote &quot;Code is the lingua franca of programmers&quot;
  on the last slide.
  This is why I have a commit bit of Scaladoc.
  My English is bad. But my code is not so bad, I think :)
