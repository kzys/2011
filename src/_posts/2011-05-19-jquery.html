  Have you bought the 6th edition of
  &quot;JavaScript: The Definitive Guide&quot;?
  In this edition, David Flanagan devotes one chapter to jQuery.

  Several years ago, I found jQuery. But it's little odd for me.
  I think <a href="http://api.jquery.com/css/">.css</a> is
  worse than .setStyle, jQuery object is too big,
  the first argument of
  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/">each</a> should not be index.
  And jQuery provides a few methods for non-DOM operation.
  I want to use more methods like
  <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable">Prototype's Enumerable</a>.
</p>
<p>
  But today, many programmers use jQuery.
  I think a famous interface is a good interface.
  And <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore</a> is
  a good complement to jQuery.
</p>
<p>
  For me, Prototype is still not so bad.
  But jQuery + Underscore is also an acceptable choice.
