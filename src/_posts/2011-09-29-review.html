  It's time to write an review article.
  In this quarter, I went to RubyKaigi and CUFP, made a
  <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/07/14/name-tag.html">little gadget</a>
  with Arduino, and decided to
  <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/08/24/driking.html">stop drinking</a>.
</p>
<p>
  RubyKaigi was really great
  but CUFP was a little bitter experience for me.
  I had did't get enough sleep, and I fall asleep during sessions.
  I'm sorry for all speakers.
  However, sessions were interesting and
  I was happy to talk with Tiark Rompf,
  Wilhelm Bierbaum, Steve Jenson and Mizushima Kota during lunch.
  I know that I need to improve my pronunciation and sentence structure.

<h3>English</h3>
<p>
  I had finished my first class at AEON. Then I went to a next class.
  Eikaiwa School
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikaiwa_school">English Wikipedia has a entry!</a>)
  is not the best way to learn English but works for me.
</p>
<p>
  English is important.
  A few years ago, many Japanese companies built softwares for
  mobile phones from top to bottom.
  However now, many people use iPhone and many companies move to Android.
  i-mode was great, but it became a foot note of our industry's history.
  What's next? Can I compete against a global team?

<h3>Introduction to Databases</h3>
<p>
  I've been working on LAMP stack for 3 years but I don't have a
  solid knowledge about RDBMS.
  That's why I decided to take Stanford's online course,
  <a href="http://www.db-class.org/course/auth/welcome">Introduction to
    Databases</a>.
  Stanford offers <a href="http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/welcome">Machine Learning</a> too but I don't have a time to take.
