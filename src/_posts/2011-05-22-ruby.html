  I've bought tickets of &quot;the last RubyKaigi&quot;.
  My favorite language is now Scala. But Ruby is still interesting.

  Programming languages trade their idea continuously.
  And Ruby has a large trade surplus:
  <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>,
  <a href="http://relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a>,
  <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>,
  <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and of course,
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">the &quot;curated&quot; framework</a>.
  I think Ruby is the lab of good programmers.
  That's why I attend RubyKaigi.

  I can't wait July!
