<p>
  Every year, I switch my blogware.
  2009 was <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>,
  2010 was <a href="http://fallabs.com/tokyopromenade/">Tokyo Promenade</a>.
  And now I've decided to use
  <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator
  by Tom Preston-Werner (of GitHub fame).
  Every post is just a file.
  You can manage your blog on your favorite version control system.
  I've pushed my repository at
  <a href="https://github.com/kzys/2011">github.com/kzys/2011.git</a>.
  If you find a typo or an error, please send an email or a pull-request.

<h3>Switch to English</h3>
<p>
  I've also decided to switch my blog from Japanese to English.
  I'm currently reading Clay Shirky's &quot;Cognitive Surplus&quot;.
  He wrote about Geocities like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    People don't actively want bad design -
    it's just that most people aren't good designers,
    but that's not going to stop them from creating things on their own.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  My English is bad, but that's not going to stop me.
  I want to share my code and ideas with other hackers around the world.
