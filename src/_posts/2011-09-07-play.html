  On May,
  <a href="//blog.8-p.info/2011/05/04/play.html">I read Play a little</a>
  and wrote:

    Honestly, I don't know why Play uses an exception.
    It's not straightforward for me.

  Then today I read a
  <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2968948">discussion</a>
  about Play 2.0 on Hacker News.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normally, exceptions are slow in Java
    because we need to generate stack trace.</li>
  <li>However Play overrides <code>fillInStackTrace</code>
    to avoid the issue.</li>
  <li>Then Play 2.0 doesn't use exceptions for flow control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, my feeling was right.</p>
