<p>
  Yesterday, I bought and read a PDF version of
  <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/">Zen To Done</a>.
  Zen To Done (ZTD) is a simplified version of Getting Things Done (GTD).
  The author of the book, Leo Babauta wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I have made many habit changes:
    I quit smoking, started running, started eating healthier,
    completed a marathon, doubled my income and got my finances in order,
    become a vegan, ...
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Fitter, happier, more productive / Comfortable / Not drinking too much ...
</p>
<p>
  However, ZTD itself is not so bad.
  I will try the simplest version that named &quot;Minimal ZTD&quot;
  in November and December.
  This version have only four habits: Collect, Process, Plan and Do.
  In this month, I will focus to get into two habits: Collect and Plan.
