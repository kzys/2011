<p>
  I had took TOEIC at October 30 and I received a result today.
  I got 395 in Listening and 355 in Reading.
  The score is still bad and I know that I can't communicate well with
  people who speak English only.
  However I took TOEIC at 2010 and the score was 645.
  It's not so bad if I have time to reward myself!
